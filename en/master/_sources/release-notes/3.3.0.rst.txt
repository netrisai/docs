Netris |version| (Dec/05/2022)
==================================

What's new in Netris |version|?
-------------------------------

Features
--------
.. New capabilities visible to customers. One line each; optional 1–2 lines of context.

**V-Net tags.**

    Equinix Metal users can now optionally use tags for associating servers with Netris V-Net service. This comes handy, especially for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) situations, to request servers and network resources in a single iteration. 

**Create V-Net based on existing unmanaged Layer-2 services in Bare Metal Cloud environments.**

    Layer-2 services that exist in a bare metal cloud environment but are not yet part of any service that is managed by Netris will show up under the V-Nets section marked as Unmanaged. Users can use the “Manage” function to easily create a new V-Net service that will automatically apply the VLAN id and the list of servers associated with.

Bug fixes
---------
.. Customer-facing defect fixes. If internal-only, keep wording generic.

**Multiple fixes to improve SoftGate nodes failover mechanisms to address high availability (HA) issues under specific circumstances.**

- SoftGate nodes now have a local data store for caching controller data to better handle situations when a SoftGate node is being booted or re-booted during headless operations when Netris controller is unreachable. 
- Access Control Lists (ACL) are applied symmetrically (where possible), so any SoftGate node is ready to permit/deny traffic in the event of a failover. Previously it required two cycles of Netris agent execution to populate ACLs after a failover event.
- Disabled preemption. For services that require active/standby operation (default gateway, SNAT) the last active SoftGate will remain active until the next failover.  
- Fixed DHCP service failover. Previously KEA DHCP server daemon was failing on standby SoftGate node + in case of headless failover Netris agent was failing to auto-generate the right configs for KEA. Both issues are resolved.
- Improved NAT service failover when using BGP to advertise public IP address space. Previously NAT failover could take up to 10 seconds randomly.
- Improved failover of static routes defined through Netris. Previously failover of static route entries was taking up to 20 seconds. 

Various improvements and bug fixes
---------------------------------------

- Users with switches running Cumulus NOS can now create security rules in inventory profiles also with any protocol, previously due to a software bug it was limited to tcp/udp only.
- More efficient auto-generation of ACL rules that are using port-ranges for SoftGate and SoftGate PRO.  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) with established=on are now using individual (per flow) “permit reversed established” rules for SoftGate nodes. While we keep using a general (for all flows) “permit anything established” for Switches to preserve TCAM. 
- API logging is fixed.
- DHCP server service is now also supported for switches running Cumulus NOS.
- Support both bonded Layer-2 and Hybrid bonded interfaces in Equinix Metal. Previously switching server interface type to Layer-2 was causing issues. 
- Netris agent managing Bare Metal Cloud environment now writes logs into Netris Controllers available under API logs section.
- Custom DHCP option sets can be attached to multiple V-Nets, previously due to a software bug it was limited to a single V-Net.
- NTP servers with FQDN are now supported in Inventory Profiles.
- L4LB used with multiple Kubernetes Clusters now can control which Kubernetes Cluster to be served through which load-balancer pool.
