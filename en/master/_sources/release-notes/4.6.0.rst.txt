Netris |version| (Jan/31/2026)
==================================

What's new in Netris |version|?
-------------------------------

Features
--------
.. New capabilities visible to customers. One line each; optional 1–2 lines of context.

- **EVPN-on-Host. Linux Host VTEP.** Any Ubuntu 24.04 host can be configured as an EVPN VTEP, therefore extending the VXLAN overlay into the host.
- **NVLink Multi-Node.** Netris can now create NVLink partitions in NVL72 and NVL144 equipped systems.
- **eBGP imports non-default routes.** The operator may now apply a BGP community 0:7 to signal Netris to import any non 0.0.0.0/0 eBGP prefixes into the VPC.
- **Control plane verification of VTEP reachability.** Netris managed VTEPs (switches and Softgates) keep track of the reachability of other Netris VTEPs.
- **CloudStack supported with Cumulus Linux.** CloudStack now integrates with Nvidia switch fabrics running Cumulus Linux.
- **Spectrum-X Deployment Guide v1.3 support** Spectrum-X Deployment Guide v1.3 is now supported.
- **SNMPv2.** Netris can now configure SNMPv2 read-only access on supported switches
- **Topology View Filtering.** Topology view now supports filtering by device name.
- **Dell/BC-SONiC VPC peering.** VPC peering can now be established on :ref:`Dell/BC-SONiC Ethernet <overlay-network-functions>` fabrics.
- **Dell/BC-SONiC L3VPN.** L3VPN is now supported on :ref:`Dell/BC-SONiC Ethernet <overlay-network-functions>` fabrics.

Enhancements
------------
.. Customer-facing enhancements to existing functionality and features. If internal-only, keep wording generic.

- **XDP dataplane acceleration for SoftGate HS**.
- **DHCP Relay** now supports inter-VPC routing on all :ref:`supported-switch-hardware`.
- **Centralized ACLs on Arista EOS** are now available on :ref:`supported-switch-hardware`.
- **Controller Management Address** can now be explicitly specified and is correctly reflected in the “one-liner” install command.
- **Inventory Filtering.** Inventory API now supports filtering by label, sites, types, health, and custom.
- **Performance and UI improvements.**

  - Add Network > Links page showing all topology links.
  - Tags are now Labels to remove confusion with VLAN tags.
  - Added NIC stats for Generic/agentless server type derived from switch ports.
  - Improved database scalability in larger deployments.
  - Server Cluster UI now displays members in alphabetical order.
  - Rename Topology Export Full to Cut Sheet.
  - CloudStack agent automatically generates ACLs for intra-subnet communication.
  - Improved collectd optical values export.
  - System ASN range is now editable.
  - Can now show more than 4 tx/rx optical signals in Optical Graph.
  - Improved SoftGate HS installation experience.
  - Improved SoftGate HS DNAT and ACL scalability.
