Netris VPC
======================

The Netris VPC offers you the ability to operate your resources within a logically segregated virtual network. You can create, edit, and remove VPCs as needed. The VPC acts as a VRF in traditional networking, providing the flexibility to employ overlapping IP ranges across various VPCs while maintaining secure management and operation of resources.

Netris Controller is preconfigured with a default system VPC-1. Use the default VPC, and create additional VPCs as needed in the future.

The following diagram shows a VPC concept in the Netris Controller.

VPC is the highest entity in the hierarchy and it spreads over all Sites. 
Take a look at the VPC features and services.

Sites
-----

For each individual deployment/region, you should define a Site. All network components and resources should be associated with their respective Site and VPC.

Physically connected sites function like an availability zone. This means that two V-Nets (Subnets) will communicate using the direct link, and even a single V-Net can span within an availability zone. Sites that are not physically connected function like regions. And Netris SiteMesh, a Wireguard-based site-to-site VPN, can be used to enable communication between these regions.


IPAM
----

You have the ability to create IP Allocations and Subnet assignments for a VPC, and these may overlap between different VPCs. A Subnet can be assigned to multiple sites if you aim to extend your V-Net across various locations.


V-Nets
------

V-Net is a virtual networking service that provides Layer-2 (unrouted) or Layer-3 (routed) virtual network segments in VPC. V-Net is assigned to one VPC and one or multiple sites. Your endpoints (servers, VMs) are connected to V-Nets.

**Note: multisite feature requires a direct physical link between Sites.**

External connections
--------------------

You can connect your VPC to ISP providers or other segments of your network using Netris E-BGP service, or statically by defining a V-Net and using Net->Routes (for natively integrated Bare Metal Cloud Providers please refer to the provider-specific tutorial, as external connections usually establish automatically

SiteMesh connections
--------------------

Connect your VPCs over an automatic Wireguard-based Site-to-Site VPN across multiple Sites if you don't have a direct link between those Sites.

**Note: works only in the system default VPC (limitation is planned to be lifted in Netris v. 4.1.0).**


NAT services
------------
SNAT allows your endpoints to communicate with the Internet. DNAT is also available.

**Note: works only in the system default VPC (limitation is planned to be lifted in Netris v. 4.1.0).**

Load-balancing service
----------------------

Use L4LB service to share the load between your endpoints. 

**Note: works only in the system default VPC (limitation is planned to be lifted in Netris v. 4.1.0).**


Access lists
------------

ACLs provide a layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.

**Note: works only in the system default VPC (limitation is planned to be lifted in Netris v. 4.1.0).**

Working with Netris VPC
-----------------------

You have the flexibility to create and manage your VPCs using any of the interfaces listed below:

* Web interface of the Netris Controller
* Terraform Netris provider
* Kubernetes Integration
* REST API
