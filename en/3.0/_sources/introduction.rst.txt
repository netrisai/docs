Introduction to Netris
======================

Netris is an automatic netops software for operating physical networks like it is a cloud. Netris automatically configures switching, routing, load-balancing, and network security based on user-defined services and policies. Netris continuously monitors the network's health and either applies software remediation or informs you of necessary actions if human intervention is required. Netris abstracts away the complexities of detailed network configuration, letting you perform efficiently by operating your physical network in a top down approach like a cloud â€“ instead of the legacy box by box operation.
