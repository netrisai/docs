Tenants
=======
IP addresses and Switch Ports are network resources that can be assigned to different Tenants to have under their management. Admin is the default tenant, and by default, it owns all the resources. The concept of Tenants can be used for sharing and delegation of control over the network resources, typically used by network teams to grant access to other teams for requesting & managing network services using the Netris Controller as a self service portal or programmatically (with Kubernetes CRDs) as part of DevOps/NetOps pipeline. 

A Tenant has just two fields, the unique name and custom description.

Example: Adding a tenant.

Permission Groups
=================
Permission Groups are a list of permissions on a per section basis that can be attached individually to a User or a User Role. Every section has a View and Edit attribute. The view defines if users with this Permission Group can see the particular section at all. Edit defines if users with this Permission Group can edit services and policies in specific sections. 

Example: Permission Group.

User Roles
==========
Permission Groups and Tenants can be either linked directly to an individual username or can be linked to a User Role object which then can be linked to an individual username.
