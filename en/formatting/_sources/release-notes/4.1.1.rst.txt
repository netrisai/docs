Bug fixes
---------
.. Customer-facing defect fixes. If internal-only, keep wording generic.

- In Equinix Metal, using tags to assign newly created servers to V-Net would previously cause the Layer-2 network provisioning to fail.
- In Equinix Metal, adding a server to an existing V-Net while server provisioning is still in process would previously cause the Layer-2 network provisioning to fail.
- The Web UI filter in the “Details” column of the E-BGP section was not working correctly with the “switch port” and “router” attributes.
- The “last minute” in E-BGP peer bandwidth graphs was showing wrong data.
- Bulk action was not working for LACP parameters of aggregate interfaces.
- Search was not working in graph add/edit dialogue in Graph Boards.
- The Monitoring notifications were missing for E-BGP peers terminated on a switch.
