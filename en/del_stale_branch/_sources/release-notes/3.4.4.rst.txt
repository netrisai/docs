Netris |version| (Sep/29/2023)
==================================

What's new in Netris |version|?
-------------------------------

Features
--------
.. New capabilities visible to customers. One line each; optional 1–2 lines of context.

1. IPv6 Support for “Site Mesh” Service:

    The “Site Mesh” (site-to-site VPN) service now fully supports IPv6.
2. Customizable “Default private-network” in PhoenixNAP:

    Now, it is possible to change the “default private-network” in PhoenixNAP deployment.
3. VLAN Support for E-BGP Service in PhoenixNAP:

    Our E-BGP service in PhoenixNAP deployments now includes VLAN support.
4. Optional “Management” IP Address for SoftGate Nodes:

    SoftGate nodes deployed in PhoenixNAP, AWS, and GCP environments no longer require a “Management” IP address, simplifying deployment options.
5. Public IP Addresses for Upstream BGP Sessions in Equinix Metal:

    In Equinix Metal deployments, upstream BGP sessions now utilize public IP addresses instead of private link-locals, aligning with Equinix’s requirements.

Bug fixes
---------
.. Customer-facing defect fixes. If internal-only, keep wording generic.

- Impossible to utilize the unmanaged V-net functionality with the same VLAN ID across multiple sites in PhoenixNAP and Equinix Metal deployments.
- The IPv6 Access Control List (ACL) did not accept “::/0” as a valid source value.

----------
