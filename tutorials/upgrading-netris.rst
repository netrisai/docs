**************************************
Netris Upgrade and Rollback Procedures
**************************************

Upgrade Procedure
=================

Due to potential database structural changes between Netris versions, it's highly recommended to take a backup of the database before upgrading. The backup will be used in the unlikely event of the need to perform a rollback.

1. To create a database backup, run the following command on the Controller:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  kubectl -n netris-controller exec -it netris-controller-mariadb-0 -- bash -c 'mysqldump -u $MARIADB_USER -p${MARIADB_PASSWORD} $MARIADB_DATABASE' > db-snapshot.sql

Ensure that SQL file ``db-snapshot.sql`` is generated in the current directory.

2. Stop all Netris agents on devices managed by the controller (switch & SoftGate).

For the switch agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl stop netris-sw

For the SoftGate agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl stop netris-sg

Ensure that all devices in the *Net → Inventory* section are ":red:`red`" with the "**check_agent**" status being "**Agent is unavailable**".

.. note::
  
  A stopped Netris agent has no impact on production traffic through the device.

.. _upgrade 3:

3. Before upgrading the Netris Controller, take a note of the "*Netris Version*" by navigating to *Setting → General* in the Controller web interface. This version number will be used in case of the need to perform a rollback procedure.

4. Start the upgrade using the one-liner.

.. code-block:: shell-session

  curl -sfL https://get.netris.ai | sh -

.. note::
  
  This process can take up to 5 minutes


Afterwards, make sure that all pods have either "*Running*" or "*Completed*" status by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  kubectl -n netris-controller get pods


The output is similar to this:

.. code-block:: shell-session

.. warning::
  
  If, after 5 minutes, you see pods with a status other than "*Running*" or "*Completed*", please reach out to us via `Slack <https://netris.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1993b09c6-dWvgWusaeysToNHn7lIGTA#/shared-invite/email>`__.

Then verify that the "*Netris Version*" reflects the version change by navigating to *Setting → General* in the Controller web interface.

5. Once you have verified that the Netris controller is up-to-date, take a note of the *Netris version:* for each device found under *Net → Inventory* section of the Controller web interface.

Afterwards, upgrade the switch & SoftGate agents using the one-liner from the "*Install Agent*" option of the corresponding device's 3-dot menu found under the *Net → Inventory* section.

After all the agents have finished the upgrade, make sure all devices in the *Net → Inventory* section have a ":green:`green`" status and the *Netris version* for each device reflects the version change.

In the event the "**check_agent**" status is "**Agent is unavailable**" after the agent upgrade has finished, perform agent restart on the affected device(s).

For the switch agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl restart netris-sw

For the SoftGate agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl restart netris-sg

Rollback Procedure
==================

A rollback procedure can be carried out in case of any adverse impact on the production traffic after the Netris upgrade.

1. Stop all Netris agents on the devices managed by the controller (switch & SoftGate).

For the switch agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl stop netris-sw

For the SoftGate agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl stop netris-sg

2. Restore the database from the previously taken snapshot.

Copy the backup file from the controller host system to the MariaDB container:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  kubectl -n netris-controller cp db-snapshot.sql netris-controller-mariadb-0:/opt/db-snapshot.sql

Restore the database:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  kubectl -n netris-controller exec -it netris-controller-mariadb-0 -- bash -c 'mysql -u root -p${MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD} $MARIADB_DATABASE < /opt/db-snapshot.sql'

3. Downgrade Netris controller application.

.. note::
  
  For the version number, use the number collected from :ref:`step #3<upgrade 3>` during the upgrade procedure.

Example:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  curl -sfL https://get.netris.ai | sh -s -- --ctl-version 3.0.9-014

Afterwards, verify that the version of the "*Netris Version*" reflects the downgraded version by navigating to *Setting → General* in the Netris Controller.

.. _downgrade 4:

4. Determine the correct version number to downgrade the device agents to:

.. _downgrade 4 sw:

For the switch agent, use ``apt policy netris-sw`` and select the latest version that matches the Controller version.

Example:

.. image:: /tutorials/images/sw_apt_policy.png
    :align: center
    :alt: SW Apt Policy Example


.. _downgrade 4 sg:

For the SoftGate agent, use ``apt policy netris-sg`` and select the latest version that matches the Controller version.

Example:

.. image:: /tutorials/images/sg_apt_policy.png
    :align: center
    :alt: SG Apt Policy Example

5. Downgrade switch and SoftGate agents.

For the switch agent follow the below example, replacing the version number determined in the pervious :ref:`step #4<downgrade 4 sw>`.

Example:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo apt-get update && apt-get install netris-sw=3.0.9.003

For the SoftGate agent follow the below example, replacing the version number determined in the pervious :ref:`step #4<downgrade 4 sg>`.

Example:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo apt-get update && apt-get install netris-sg=3.0.9.002

After all the switches and SoftGates have been downgraded, make sure all the devices in the *Net → Inventory* section have a ":green:`green`" status and the Netris version for each device matches what was determined in :ref:`step #4<downgrade 4>`.

In case the "**check_agent**" status is "**Agent is unavailable**" after agent downgrade, perform agent restart.

For the switch agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl restart netris-sw

For the SoftGate agent:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  sudo systemctl restart netris-sg
