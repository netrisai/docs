*************************
Welcome to Netris Sandbox
*************************

Netris sandbox is a ready-to-use environment for testing Netris automatic NetOps. 
We have pre-created some example services for you, details of which can be found in the :ref:`"Provided Example Configurations"<s9-pre-configured>` document. Feel free to view, edit, delete, and create new services. Reach out to us if you have any questions at https://netris.ai/slack 

The credentials for the sandbox have been provided to you by email in response to your sandbox request.

This environment includes:

* **Netris Controller**: A cloud-hosted Netris controller, loaded with examples.
* **Switching fabric**: Two spine switches and four leaf switches, all Netris-operated.
* **SoftGates**: Two SoftGate gateway nodes for border routing, L4 Load Balancing, site-to-site VPN, and NAT. Both Netris-operated.
* **Linux servers**: Five Linux servers, with root access where you can run any applications for your tests.
* **Kubernetes cluster**: A 3 node Kubernetes cluster, user integratable with Netris controller, feel free to deploy any applications for your tests.
* **ISP**: Internet upstream, providing the sandbox Internet connectivity with real-world routable public IP addresses.

Linux servers
=============

Example pre-configured Netris services:
 * srv01, srv02, srv03 & Netris Controller - are consuming a ROH (Routing On Host) Netris example service, see Services-->ROH.
 * srv01, srv02 - are behind Anycast L3 load balancer.
 * srv04, srv05 - are consuming a V-NET (routed VXLAN) Netris example service, see Services-->V-NET.


Accessing Linux servers:
  
.. code-block:: shell-session  
  
  srv01: ssh demo@166.88.17.19 -p 30061
  srv02: ssh demo@166.88.17.19 -p 30062
  srv03: ssh demo@166.88.17.19 -p 30063
  srv04: ssh demo@166.88.17.19 -p 30064
  srv05: ssh demo@166.88.17.19 -p 30065
  

Kubernetes cluster
==================
This sandbox provides an up and running 3 node Kubernetes cluster. You can integrate it with the Netris controller by installing **netris-operator**. Step-by-step instructions are included in the :ref:`"Run an On-Prem Kubernetes Cluster with Netris Automatic NetOps"<s9-k8s>` document.


Upstream ISP
============
This sandbox provides an upstream ISP service with real-world Internet routing. 
There is one pre-configured example under NET-->E-BGP service, which is advertising the public IP subnet to the upstream ISP IRIS.

ISP settings:

.. code-block:: shell-session
