Welcome to Netris Sandbox
*************************

Netris sandbox is a ready-to-use environment for testing Netris automatic NetOps. 
We have created some example services for you. Feel free to view, edit, and create new services. Reach out to us if you have any questions. https://netris.ai/slack 

This environment provides:

* Netris Controller: A cloud-hosted Netris controller, loaded with examples.
* Switching fabric: Two spine switches and four leaf switches, all Netris-operated.
* SoftGate: Two SoftGate gateway nodes for border routing, L4 Load Balancing, site-to-site VPN, and NAT. Both Netris-operated.
* Linux servers: Four Linux servers, with root access where you can run any applications for your tests.
* Kubernetes cluster: A 3 node Kubernetes cluster, integrated with Netris controller, feel free to deploy any applications for your tests.
* ISP: Internet upstream, providing the sandbox Internet connectivity with real-world routable public IP addresses.

Accessing Linux servers
=======================
.. code-block:: shell-session

  srv01: ssh demo@166.88.17.22 -p 23061
  srv02: ssh demo@166.88.17.22 -p 23062
  srv03: ssh demo@166.88.17.22 -p 23063
  srv04: ssh demo@166.88.17.22 -p 23064
  

Accessing Kubernetes cluster
============================
In Netris GUI, navigate to Services-->Kubenet. You'll find a pre-configured example Kubenet. Kubenet is a network service purpose built for serving to Kubernetes nodes. Edit the service and copy "Kubeconfig" from the example service into your ".kube/config" on your local machine. Now you should be able to kubectl the sandbox cluster.
